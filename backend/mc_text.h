/* mc_text.h : the NASM text sink for the shared x86-64 selector.

   Implements the backend/mc.h sink interface by writing NASM (elf64) assembly,
   the form the AOT compiler emits and nasm assembles.  The driver creates a
   sink over an output stream, resets the label namespace before each function,
   and (after selecting a function) checks whether the sink hit an unresolved
   symbol. */
