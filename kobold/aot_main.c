/* aot_main.c : skj-kp, the ahead-of-time compiler for Kobold modules.

   Reads a KPM1 text module (the Kobold front end's output) and writes native
   assembly through the shared instruction selector and text sink, the same
   selector the JIT drives.  This is the AOT counterpart of skj-kp-jit: instead of
   emitting machine code into a mapped buffer and running it, it writes an assembly
   file that an assembler and linker turn into a native object.

   The emitted object calls the Kobold runtime by symbol (io_write_str,
   kp_str_concat, and so on), which the final link resolves against the runtime
   library plus a small C start file (kobold/aot_crt.c): that file owns the process
   entry, sets up the low-memory guest heap and stack, and calls the guest program
   through kp_call_guest.  So the program's own entry is renamed here to a fixed
   symbol the start file calls, leaving `main` to the C runtime. */

/* The JIT binds a few guest-facing runtime names to differently named host
   implementations (kp_install_runtime does the remapping in its table).  AOT
   resolves calls by linker symbol instead, so the same map is applied here to the
   call targets; this table mirrors that one.  What needs remapping:

     - The coroutine operators: the guest calls kp_co_new and friends, whose real
       implementations are the vm-less shims kp_co_new_g (co.c owns the bare names
       with a different, vm-taking signature).
     - ParamCount / ParamStr / heapLive, which the runtime provides under C names.
     - The transcendentals (kp_sin and friends), which wrap the C library.
     - On rv32 only: the real-valued I/O and Val, which cross the call in an integer
       register pair (the soft-float ilp32 ABI the backend emits) and so go through
       the bits bridge in kp_host.c; and the stack-ABI 64-bit multiply and shifts
       (the backend's rv lowering), which carry skj_jit_* names so they do not
       collide with the runtime's own register-ABI libgcc helpers.  The __divdi3
       family uses the register ABI on both sides, so it resolves to libgcc with no
       remap.

   Every other runtime name the guest emits is provided under that exact name by
   the AOT runtime, so it is absent here and resolves directly at link. */
