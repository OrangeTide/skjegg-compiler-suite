/* obj.h : the guest-owned managed-object model shared by the string, dynamic
   array, and coroutine runtimes.

   A guest-owned managed value (a string, a dynamic array, or a coroutine) is a
   gheap object whose first two words are a reference count and a kind tag. The
   value the front end passes around is the object's guest address, which the
   guest heap keeps 16-aligned, so its low bit is 0. That makes it disjoint from a
   host-handle value, a table id tagged with low bit 1 (see handle.c), and from
   nil, which is 0. kp_retain and kp_release route on the low bit: a table id to
   the handle table, a gheap object to the per-kind finalizer the VM holds.

   Only guest-owned data lives in a gheap object. A host opaque handle stays a
   table id so its host pointer and method table never sit in guest-addressable
   memory. */

/* A guest value: the address of a gheap object, a host-handle table id, or nil.
   It is pointer-width, which follows the target: 4 bytes under ILP32 (rv32, cf,
   mips) and 8 under LP64 (x86-64, arm64, KP_LP64). The LP64 JIT and AOT hosts map
   the guest heap in full memory, so a guest address can exceed 32 bits; it must
   never be narrowed to uint32_t. kp_word is the same width, for a value that
   shares a guest pointer's lane (a key-slot stride, an untyped payload word). The
   object header below (refcount, kind) and the string header stay width-neutral:
   they are counts and tags, not addresses. */
