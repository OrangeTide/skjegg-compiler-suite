/* A dynamic array (`array of T`) is a guest-heap object: a {refcount, kind} header, then
   the element count, the element width, and the storage. Its value is the object's guest
   address; 0 is nil, counted as the empty array. The element storage is a separate
   guest-heap block, so guest code addresses an element inline: the code generator takes the
   base with kp_arr_base and the length with kp_arr_len and indexes directly, bounds-checking
   against the length at the index site. The object stays put across a resize even though the
   storage block may move, so the value is stable.

   kp_arr_setlen resizes the storage. `elemsize` is the element width in bytes (any size, so
   a record element works). `layout` is a guest address of a handle-field map, or 0 when an
   element holds no handles: a count (int32) followed by that many int32 byte offsets, the
   position of each refcounted handle id within one element. The runtime releases those
   handles when a shrink drops elements and when the array is reclaimed. `elemsize` and
   `layout` are read only when the array is created from nil.

   It returns an owned reference (fresh from nil, else the same id retained), so the caller
   stores the result and releases the previous value under the ordinary handle-assignment
   discipline. */

   is base + sum(ij * strides[j]). kp_buf_new_2d is the texture-surface convenience: `rows` by
   `cols` with byte row `pitch` (>= cols*elemsize when rows are padded) and the element size as
   the column stride. ARC frees the descriptor and its shape blob on release, never the backing.
   kp_buf_ndim/kp_buf_dim/kp_buf_stride report the shape (also the guest's per-axis index path). */

/* The buffer FFI accessors: the checked boundary a host function crosses to read or write a
   buffer (or any dynamic array) it received as an argument. The host works in element indices,
   never a raw guest pointer, and every access is bounds checked against the object's element
   count. kp_buf_len returns the count (-1 if the id is nil or not an array/buffer). kp_buf_read
   copies n elements [off, off+n) out to dst, kp_buf_write copies n elements from src in; each
   returns 1 on success, 0 when the range is out of bounds or the id is invalid. kp_buf_map is
   the opt-in zero-copy escape hatch: it bounds checks once and returns a direct host pointer to
   the element range, or NULL when out of range. A string or coroutine id is rejected. */
