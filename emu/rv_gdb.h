/* rv_gdb.h : a GDB remote-serial-protocol server for the RV32 user machine.

   skj-run opens this stub with --gdb PORT: it listens on a TCP port, waits for
   a debugger (gdb, or the in-tree skj-dbg) to connect, and drives one process
   under the RSP subset the debugger plan calls for: `?`, `g`/`G`, `p`/`P`,
   `m`/`M` (bound checked), `c`, `s`, `Z0`/`z0` software breakpoints, the raw
   Ctrl-C interrupt byte, and `qSupported` with a RISC-V target description.

   Breakpoints are kept in a host-side table checked while single-stepping, so
   guest memory is never patched: that sidesteps the decoded-instruction cache
   (which has no per-PC invalidator) and the mtvec-vectoring of a guest ebreak.
   v1 debugs the root process only. */
