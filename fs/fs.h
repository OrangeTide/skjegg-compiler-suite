/* fs/ - the shared file system switch for the sandbox runtime.
 *
 * A flat mount table of named, independent namespaces with a selected current
 * one.  This is NOT a VFS: there are no subdirectory mounts, no mount-point
 * crossing, and no union, so a path never spans two backends.  It is the old
 * "file system switch" idea: file operations dispatched to a pluggable backend
 * chosen through the mount table.
 *
 * The layer is language-agnostic.  C and Kobold (and every other front end)
 * share one sandbox seam: identical interfaces, data structures, and system
 * calls.  Everything here is plain C.  The C libc file path and the Kobold
 * runtime file path are both thin adapters that convert their own string type
 * to these calls; neither owns this layer.
 *
 * Paths select a mount by a `name:` prefix (name is at most FS_NAME_MAX bytes),
 * or, with no prefix, resolve against the current mount.  Within a mount the
 * grammar follows DOS drive letters:
 *     name:/sub  mount `name`, from its root
 *     name:sub   mount `name`, from that mount's current directory
 *     /sub       current mount, from its root
 *     sub        current mount, from its current directory

 * grammar and stripped the `name:` selector and any leading '/', so `rel` is a
 * backend-relative path, "" meaning the base directory itself).  Confinement to
 * the mount is the backend's job (hostfs: host openat + RESOLVE_BENEATH; ramfs:
 * it only has its own nodes).  `open` returns a backend handle (fs.c wraps it in
 * an fd); FS_O_DIRECTORY opens a directory handle, which `readdir` then walks.
 * `read`/`write`/`readdir` get a pointer to the fd's position/cursor that fs.c
 * stores, so a backend that tracks its own offset (host, via the kernel fd or
 * DIR*) may ignore it.  `close` gets an is_dir hint so a backend that uses a
 * distinct directory handle (hostfs's DIR*) frees the right thing.
 *
 * Returns follow the kpf_* convention: >= 0 on success (a handle, a byte count,
 * or a boolean), negative errno-style on failure.  Byte counts are bounded by
 * sandbox buffer sizes, so `int` is sufficient; a file size is 64-bit. */
