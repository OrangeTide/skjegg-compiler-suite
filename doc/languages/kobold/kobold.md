# Kobold-Pascal front end (`kobold/`)

Kobold-Pascal reaches the shared IR through a different seam from the other
front ends. Its compiler, `kpcom`, is a self-hosting Pascal program whose source
is in this tree (`kobold/kpcom.pas`); skjegg is its home, not a consumer of some
other Kobold tree. Because `kpcom` is written in Pascal and compiles itself, the
tree has no `lex.c`/`parse.c`/`lower.c` for it in `backend/`'s sense. The bridge
into the rest of the toolkit is the **KPM1 text module** that `kpcom` emits:
`kobold/kpm.c` reads a KPM1 image into an `ir_program`, and from there the same
selector and sinks the C compiler uses emit the code. Every other front end is a
source-to-IR pipeline; Kobold is a self-hosting Pascal compiler whose output is
read back through an IR-in-a-text-format reader in front of the same backend.

`kobold/kpm.c` is the practical source of truth for the KPM1 format, and this
file is the in-tree reference for how the front end is built, bootstrapped, and
run.

## Source file extensions: `.kp` versus `.pas`

Kobold source files use the `.kp` extension. Pascal source files (the Compact
Pascal front end, `pascal/`) use `.pas`. The two languages are distinct, so a
project that uses both should keep the extensions apart.

`kobold/kpcom.pas` is the one deliberate exception. The Kobold compiler is
self-hosting and is written in the subset common to both languages, so its
single source file is valid Pascal and valid Kobold at the same time. It keeps
the `.pas` extension because the bootstrap compiles it with the Compact Pascal
front end (`skj-pc`) before a Kobold compiler exists. No other file in a project
should rely on this dual-language property; treat it as unique to `kpcom`.

One in-tree inconsistency to be aware of: the historical Kobold test corpus
under `tests/kp-corpus/` and `tests/kp-src/` still carries `.pas`, predating the
`.kp` convention. The tools select the language from how they are invoked, not
from the suffix, so those tests compile as Kobold regardless. New Kobold code,
in this tree or in a consuming project, should use `.kp`.

## The bootstrap: no committed seed

`kpcom` is written in its own language, so the tree cannot compile
`kobold/kpcom.pas` with a C front end. The bootstrap root is `skj-pc`, the
Compact Pascal compiler: `kpcom.pas` is valid Pascal as well as Kobold (the one
file that is both, see "Source file extensions" above), so `skj-pc` compiles it
directly into a host front end with no prior Kobold compiler and no committed
seed. There is no `prebuild/` artifact.

One front end per target, the C-compiler model: `skj-pc` compiles `kpcom.pas`
with that target baked in (a `KP_TARGET_*` define) into a host binary that emits
modules for exactly that target. The host front ends are `skj-kpc` (x86-64),
`skj-kpc-rv` (rv32), and `skj-kpc-cf` (ColdFire). Each then emits its own source
as that target's KPM1 **seed** at build time:

- `build/kpcom-rv.kpm` (from `skj-kpc-rv`): feeds the RV32 JIT (`bin2c` embeds
  it) and the RV32 self-host ELF.
- `build/kpcom-cf.kpm` (from `skj-kpc-cf`): feeds the ColdFire self-host ELF.
- `build/kpcom-lp64.kpm` (from `skj-kpc`): feeds the x86-64 JIT.

A seed is bound to its target (its `.target` header names the architecture:
`rv32`, `cf`, `x86-64`), so the KPM1 reader rejects a seed built for another
target rather than reading it at the wrong model. Pointer width is a consequence
of the target, not a separate axis.

The front-end source lives in `kobold/`, beside the runtime and reader:

- `kobold/kpcom.pas`: the whole front end (lexer, parser, semantics, IR, KPM1
  writer), one Pascal file.
- `kobold/version.inc`, `kobold/stdlib.inc`: the two `{$I ...}` includes
  `kpcom.pas` pulls in (`KP_VERSION`, `KP_STDLIB`). Their bytes are compiled into
  the IR as string constants (the stdlib path in particular), so a seed
  reproduces byte-identically only when regenerated against these same includes.

### The self-host and compiler-independence checks

- The in-guest self-host (`test-{rv,cf}-selfhost-kpc` and the `-full` variants)
  runs the Kobold compiler on the target under `skj-run`: it compiles a program
  (and, for `-full`, the whole of `kpcom.pas`) in-guest and asserts the emitted
  KPM1 matches the host front end's reference byte for byte.
- `make bootstrap-fpc` is the compiler-independence proof. It builds `kpcom.pas`
  with `fpc` (a toolchain independent of skjegg) targeting rv32, and asserts the
  module it emits matches `build/kpcom-rv.kpm` byte for byte: the module a front
  end emits is fixed by its own logic, not by which compiler built it.

### Vendoring

`vendor.sh kobold` ships the Kobold AOT path as one selection: the front-end
source, the KPM1 reader and runtime (`kobold/`), the x86-64 selector the host
tools build on, and the `jit/` call trampoline `libkpaot.a` links. There is no
committed seed; vendor.sh generates the x86-64 seed from source at vendor time
and ships it as `prebuild/kpcom.kpm`, so the consumer AOT-compiles it with
`skj-kp` into `skj-kpc` without needing `skj-pc` or `fpc`. It generates the
`skjegg.mk` rules for `skj-kp` (the KPM1 compiler), `skj-kpc` (the native front
end), and `libkpaot.a`. Adding `riscv` also generates `skj-kp-rv` (the KPM1 to
RV32 compiler). The hosted RV32 runtime (`libkpaot-rv.a`) and the freestanding
runtime tier arrive with later steps. The selection carries its own x86-64
backend, so it needs no separate backend selection; it needs `nasm` to assemble
the seed, as the rest of the x86 path already does.

## Tools

All built by `make all`. The reader regression and the source fixtures are in
`check-all` (see Testing).

- **`skj-kp-jit`** (`kobold/jit_main.c`): the in-process JIT. Reads a KPM1 module or
  a `.pas` source (which it compiles with the embedded front end, see Source
  compilation), JITs it over the byte sink, and runs it in the current process.
  Maps a low-memory guest heap (the ILP32 address model), searches the program
  directory, `KOBOLD_UNITS`, and a stdlib path for `uses` dependencies, and
  passes guest `argv` through. `--emit-kpm` stops after the module, writing it to
  stdout or, with `-o outfile`, to a file (options precede the source).
  `skj-kp-jit-rv` and `skj-kp-jit-arm64` are the cross-arch counterparts over the
  same driver and runtime.
- **`skj-kpc`** (the seed AOT-compiled to native code, linked against
  `libkpaot.a`): the native front end, `kpcom` running with no JIT. Reads a
  `.pas` source and writes its KPM1 module (`--emit-kpm`, to stdout or `-o
  outfile`; options precede the source). It runs on the host, so it is the front
  end for a cross AOT build too: the host `skj-kpc` emits the module and a cross
  `skj-kp-*` compiles it. `skj-kpc-rv` and `skj-kpc-arm64` are the proof the front
  end itself AOT-compiles and runs on each backend (under qemu); all three emit
  byte-identical KPM1.
- **`skj-kp`** (`kobold/aot_main.c`): the ahead-of-time compiler. Emits native
  assembly over the text sink for a C start file to assemble and link.
  `skj-kp-rv` and `skj-kp-arm64` emit GNU-as assembly for those targets.
- **`skj-kp-patrol`** (`kobold/patrol_main.c`): a sample embedding host that
  registers an opaque handle type of its own beside the standard runtime, the
  counterpart of the C JIT's embedding sample.

The JIT and AOT paths are kept at byte-identical-stdout parity with the
reference `kprun` across the behavioral corpus, on x86-64, arm64, and rv32,
for single-module and multi-unit programs, overflow traps included.

## Source compilation

The front end (`kpcom`) is a Kobold program, built from source per target by
`skj-pc` (see "The bootstrap: no committed seed"). A tool runs it to turn `.pas`
source into a KPM1 module, and there are two ways to run it.

The **JIT path** carries a seed inside the binary. `build/kpcom_kpm.c` is the
RV32 seed (`build/kpcom-rv.kpm`) as a C byte array, generated by `kobold/bin2c.c`
and linked into the RV32 JIT; the x86-64 and arm64 JITs embed their own seeds the
same way. When a JIT tool is handed a `.pas` input,
`kobold/frontend.c:kp_compile_pas` JITs the embedded seed in-process, binds the
runtime, calls its `compile` export with the source name and text, and reads back
the produced module. So `skj-kp-jit foo.pas` compiles and runs source in one
process, and `skj-kp-jit --emit-kpm foo.pas` stops after writing the module. The
`KPCOM_KPM` environment variable overrides the embedded seed with a module on
disk for dev iteration.

The **AOT path** runs a native front-end binary built directly from source.
`skj-kpc` (x86-64), `skj-kpc-rv`, and `skj-kpc-cf` are `skj-pc` compiling
`kpcom.pas` with that target baked in, linked against the host harness, so each
runs the front end with no JIT: `skj-kpc --emit-kpm foo.pas` reads source and
writes a module stamped for that target. The front end runs on the host, so a
cross AOT build is two steps: the host front end for the target emits the module,
then that target's backend (`skj-kp-rv` / `skj-kp-cf` / `skj-kp-arm64`) compiles
it. (Vendored trees instead build `skj-kpc` by AOT-compiling a vendor-time seed
with `skj-kp`, since they ship no `skj-pc`.)

A module is bound to one target, not merely one width: its `.target` line records
the architecture (`rv32`, `cf`, `x86-64`, `arm64`), and a backend rejects a
module built for another architecture. Pointer width is a consequence of the
target (4 bytes for rv32/cf, 8 for x86-64/arm64), not a separate category: there
is no shared "ilp32" or "lp64" module. The integer core and control flow are the
same across targets; only the pointer and `int64` opcodes follow the width.

## The KPM1 text module format

A module is a sequence of lines. Blank lines and `;` comment lines are ignored;
leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed. The first non-empty line must be
the header `.kpm 1`.

### Top-level directives

- `.kpm 1`: header and version (required, first).
- `.target <name>`: a target hint (optional).
- `.module <kind> [name]`: `kind` is `object` (the default: a compiled unit
  for linking), `library`, or `executable`. An `object` carries its own unit
  name so a consumer's `.uses` can be matched against it.
- `.entry <routine>`: the entry routine of an executable.
- `.uses <name> [fingerprint <n>]`: a direct unit dependency and the interface
  fingerprint it was compiled against. The linker checks the fingerprint
  against the loaded dependency's own, rejecting interface skew.
- `.interface fingerprint <n> ... .endinterface`: a self-delimiting interface
  block a consumer type-checks against. The reader records only the fingerprint
  and skips the body.
- `.file "<path>"`: the debug source hint (`-g`).
- `.import <kind> <name> ...`: a symbol the host must provide. `kind` is
  `func` (a host function), `helper` (a compiler runtime helper), or `type` (a
  host handle type; carries `methods <n>` and a signature per vtable slot, as
  ABI class tokens).
- `.export <name>`: a symbol this module exports.
- `.global ...` and `.func ...`: see below.

### Globals

```
.global <name> <base> [array <n>] [align <a>] [local] [ptr] [export] [rodata] [from <unit>]
    .init <value>            ; a scalar initializer word
    .init sym <symbol>       ; an address-of-symbol relocation
    .string "<text>"         ; a string/byte initializer
.endglobal
```

`<base>` is `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, or `f64`. `array <n>` makes it an
array; `align <a>` sets the alignment; `ptr`, `export`, `rodata`, `local`, and
`from <unit>` set the corresponding flags.

### Functions and instructions

```
.func <name> [local] [from <unit>] [variadic] params <n> slots <n> temps <n> labels <n>
    .slotsize <s0> <s1> ...  ; per-slot byte sizes
    .paramclass <c0> ...     ; per-param class: 0 = int/pointer, 1 = float
    .paramfw <f0> ...        ; per-param: 1 = single-precision float scalar
    <OP> [key=value] ...     ; one IR instruction per line
    ...
.endfunc
```

`<OP>` is an `ir_op` mnemonic without the `IR_` prefix (e.g. `ADD`, `LW`,
`FCALL`; the full table is `op_table` in `kobold/kpm.c`). The operand keys are:

| key     | meaning                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `dst`   | destination temp index (`0 <= dst < temps`, or `-1` for none) |
| `a`,`b` | operand temp indices (`0 <= a,b < temps`, or `-1` for none)   |
| `imm`   | 64-bit immediate (a `LIC64` value, an f64's bits)   |
| `slot`  | local-slot index (`0 <= slot < slots`)              |
| `label` | label index (`0 <= label < labels`)                 |
| `nargs` | argument count for a call                           |
| `sym`   | a symbol name (call target, address-of)             |

The psABI hint lines `.paramneb`, `.paramcls`, `.retneb`, and `.retcls` are
accepted and ignored for the v1 subset; the reader derives the psABI fields a
backend needs from `.paramclass` (one register slot per parameter, SSE for a
float).

### Input validation

The format is read from untrusted text, so the reader bounds everything it will
later use as an allocation size or an array index. Declared counts (a
function's `params`/`slots`/`temps`/`labels`, a global's `array` size, an
imported type's `methods`) are rejected if negative or above `KPM_MAX_COUNT`
(`1 << 20`). Every temp, slot, and label index an instruction names is checked
against the enclosing function's declared counts, so a module cannot drive an
out-of-bounds access into `temp_reg[]`, the slot table, or the label table
downstream. A field a line does not provide is left at its default and not
checked, so a legitimate instruction that uses no temp (a `JMP` in a function
with `temps 0`) still reads. This path is exercised by `make check-kp`.

## The guest runtime (`kobold/`)

The runtime is the Kobold guest runtime, compiled freestanding with f64
reals. It is shared between the JIT (bound as host symbols) and the AOT path
(resolved by the linker).

- `str_core.c`, `str_fmt.c`: the guest-owned string object and number
  formatting/parsing (`Str`, `Val`).
- `dynarr.c`: the guest-owned dynamic array (`array of T`).
- `map.c`: the guest-owned string-keyed associative array (`map of T`).
- `co.c`, `co_shim.c`: stackful coroutines (the coroutine runtime) and the
  host primitives they need. The per-arch context switch is
  `runtime/co_switch_{x86,arm64,rv}.S`, shared with the libc coroutine
  primitive (`doc/tools/libc.md`).
- `handle.h`: refcounted (ARC) opaque handles.
- `rt_host.c`: the platform layer: the guest heap over a low-memory mmap (so a
  guest address fits the 32 bits the front end models), plus a live-bytes
  counter.
- `kp_host.c`, `kp_host.h`: the standard host binding surface. An embedder
  calls `kp_install_runtime` to fill a `kp_binding` table (console I/O,
  strings, arrays, maps, coroutines, ARC, traps, and the 64-bit divide
  helpers), then binds its own host types, then calls `kp_jit`.
  `kp_io_set_args` records the command line for `ParamStr`/`ParamCount`, and
  `kp_handle_sweep` runs live handles' finalizers at teardown.
- `aot_rt.c`: the C start file and link-time runtime surface for `skj-kp`
  output: process entry, a low execution stack, the traps, and the
  `ParamStr`/`ParamCount` surface.

## The binding model

A guest reaches the runtime by name. The two paths resolve those names
differently.

- **JIT**: `kp_install_runtime` binds each guest-facing name to a host symbol
  in a `kp_binding` table, and `kp_jit` resolves the IR's call and data
  relocations against it.
- **AOT**: the names are resolved by the system linker. `aot_main.c`'s
  `remap_sym` mirrors `kp_install_runtime` for the names that appear as call
  symbols in the IR (the coroutine operators, `ParamCount`/`ParamStr`/
  `heapLive`, the transcendentals, and on rv32 the real-valued I/O and `Val`,
  which cross a call as integer-register bits under the soft-float ABI and so
  go through a bits bridge). `-DKP_AOT_RV` selects the rv branch.
  `rv_i64_aot_alias.S` defines the libgcc-named 64-bit multiply/shift helpers
  as tail-jumps into the runtime's `skj_jit_*` routines, since the rv backend
  writes those names directly rather than as call symbols `remap_sym` can see.

## The freestanding tier

A downstream host (boris and the like) runs a Kobold guest with no host OS: its
seam to the guest is only `write`, `read`, and `exit`, and it hands the guest its
heap at entry rather than letting the runtime map memory. `libkpaot-rv-free.a` is
the re-bottoming of the hosted `libkpaot-rv.a` for that seam. The compute
runtime (`str_core.c`, `dynarr.c`, `map.c`) is the same source, built with
`KP_FREESTANDING`; only the platform underneath changes.

For the end-to-end commands that compile a `.pas` into a freestanding RV32 ELF
and run it in the `skj-run` emulator, see `kp-sandbox.md`.

- `kobold/rt_free.c` is the platform, the freestanding `rt_host.c`. The guest heap is
  the same binned allocator over a flat region, but the region is handed in by
  `kp_rt_init(base, size)` rather than mapped; a block address is a real pointer,
  so the host places the region below 4 GB. It also holds the reference counter,
  the finalizer registry, the `mem*` primitives, and the traps, which write a
  one-line diagnostic and `exit(70)`.
- `kobold/kp_io.c` is the one console implementation, shared by the freestanding
  and the hosted runtimes. Output goes straight to the `write` syscall (no stdio),
  input through `read` with a single byte of pushback for the numeric and line
  reads; the integer formatting and parsing are hand-rolled with no libc (the
  hosted `str_fmt.c` uses `snprintf`/`strtod`, which this tier cannot). Only
  `io_write_real` is per tier, since its `%g` renderer differs.
- `kobold/io_free.c` is the rest of the freestanding `kp_host.c`: the per-tier
  real output (`io_write_real`), the integer `Str`/`Val`, file I/O, the `brv_*`
  soft-float real bridges, and `ParamCount`/`ParamStr` over the entry argument
  vector.
- `kobold/kp_crt_rv.S` is the skjegg test crt: `_start` runs on the entry stack, hands
  the runtime a reserved bss heap region and the argument vector, enters
  `kp_guest_entry`, and exits 0 on return (a program ends nonzero only through
  `Halt`). A real host supplies its own crt and memory region and calls
  `kp_rt_init` with them; nothing in `rt_free.c` or `io_free.c` depends on a
  syscall but the `_exit` the trap makes.

The syscall seam `io_free.c` builds on is the POSIX-standard set `write`, `read`,
and `_exit` (plus `open` and `close` on ColdFire), the same names the C libc
links, so the Kobold freestanding runtime and the C runtime speak one syscall
seam (`runtime/io_free_rv.S`, `runtime/io_free_cf.S`).

The console in `kp_io.c` writes and reads that seam directly rather than through a
buffered-stream core: the only state it keeps is one byte of input pushback (the
irreducible lookahead the numeric and line reads need), not a `BUFSIZ` stdio
buffer. Output is therefore unbuffered, so nothing has to be flushed before the
process ends; `io_halt` simply `_exit`s, and the normal-return path still goes
through it (ABI version 3). (The C libc's own `libc/stdio_core.c` is unaffected: it
is still the buffered-stream core for C programs; the Kobold console no longer
routes through it.)

The entry seam (`kp_set_raw_args`, `kp_rt_init`, `kp_guest_entry`, `_exit`)
is a published ABI a downstream host links against, so it is versioned
(`kobold/kp_abi.h`, `KP_GUEST_ABI_VERSION`). `rt_free.c` defines the symbol
`kp_guest_abi_v<N>` and the plain value `kp_guest_abi_version`, and the crt
references `kp_guest_abi_v<N>`; an archive of one version linked against a crt of
another leaves that symbol undefined, so the mismatch is a link error rather than
a silent seam skew. A host that writes its own crt carries the same reference, and
a bump of the entry seam bumps the version here, in `rt_free.c`, and in the crt
together.

The 64-bit integer helpers are the hosted archive's: the backend's stack-ABI
`__muldi3` and shift family resolve through `rv_i64_aot_alias.S` into
`jit/rv_jit_i64.S`, and the register-ABI `__divdi3` family comes from
`runtime/soft64.c` built `-DSOFT64_NO_MULSHIFT` (so its own stack-ABI-incompatible
multiply and shifts are dropped and do not clash with the alias).

`kobold/co_free.c` is the coroutine runtime, the freestanding counterpart of the
hosted `co.c` + `co_shim.c`. A coroutine is an ordinary gheap object (kind
`KP_OBJ_CORO`), counted by `rt_free.c` like any other value; its private stack is
a gheap block rather than a guarded mapping (no mmap, so no guard page, the
accepted trade). The context switch is `co_switch_rv.S`, whose 160-byte saved
block the file seeds; the entry and value ABI match what `skj-kp-rv` emits
(`kp_co_new(entry, argsp, nargs)`, 8-byte argument cells, a 32-bit resume/yield
value). Reals are covered too: `io_free.c` has a `%g`-matching double formatter
(six significant digits, trailing zeros stripped, validated against the C library)
behind `io_write_real`, a `double` parse behind `kp_str_val_real`, and the rv
soft-float bit bridge (`brv_write_real`/`brv_read_real`/`brv_val_real`). The
transcendentals (`sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `ln`, `arctan`) are in `kobold/math_free.c`,
computed in hardware double with range reduction and series since the tier has no
libm; they are accurate to well under the `%g` six-digit output, so they
reproduce the hosted (libm) results exactly, checked against the C library over a
wide range. The tier is at full parity with the hosted one.

`make check-kp-free` is the end-to-end proof: each `tests/kp-src` fixture goes
`skj-kpc --emit-kpm` -> `skj-kp-rv` -> `skj-as-rv` -> `skj-ld-rv` into a static
rv32 ELF linked against the crt and `libkpaot-rv-free.a`, run under qemu-riscv32,
stdout compared to `.expected`. It is in `check-emu-all`. The portable
`tests/kp-src` set it runs covers integers, strings, int64, parameters, reals
(`realfmt`), and coroutines (`coro`).

## Multi-unit linking

A program that `uses` units links across modules.

- **JIT** (`jit/jit_common.c`): each unit is compiled per-module and its
  exports are published as bindings. A cross-module call lands on a per-export
  stub that tail-jumps through a writable slot (`kp_stubs_*`), so linking is
  order-independent: a slot can be filled after the caller is compiled. The
  stub touches only a scratch register, so the guest's argument registers and
  return address pass through untouched.
- **AOT**: `aot_main.c` gives every name in the module's `.export` list
  external linkage before emitting, so the system linker resolves it; a private
  symbol a unit does not export stays local, so two units' same-named private
  globals do not collide. `kobold/aot-run.sh` follows the main module's `.uses`
  transitively, compiles each dependency unit (resolving `<dir>/<name>.kpm`
  then `KOBOLD_UNITS`, as `kprun` does), and links the whole set, the system
  linker standing in for the JIT's in-memory link.

## Overflow-trap policy

Kobold's semantics trap on integer overflow, and its JIT does. The shared AOT
text sinks default to the hardware-trap policy they share with the C compiler
(a checked arithmetic op, which C never emits, would otherwise wrap). So
`aot_main.c` raises `target_aot_trap_guarded` (a mode flag in `ir.c`, default
off) before `target_emit`, which makes the x86-64 and arm64 text sinks choose
the selector's guarded trap policy; rv always guards and ignores the flag. The
C compiler is unaffected: the flag defaults to hardware and only `aot_main.c`
raises it, and the checked ops never appear in C.

## Testing

- **In-tree, reader**: `make check-kp` runs `tests/kp/` through `skj-kp`,
  exercising the KPM1 reader's input validation (malformed modules rejected with
  a pinned, line-numbered message; a well-formed module compiles). It needs no
  external repo, qemu, assembler, or linker. The shared JIT the Kobold tools
  drive is also covered by `make check-jit` / `check-jit-arm64` / `check-jit-rv`
  through the C suite.
- **In-tree, reader fuzz**: `make test-kpm-fuzz` drives the whole untrusted
  reader path (`kpm_read` -> `regalloc` -> `target_emit`) under ASan plus UBSan,
  mutating copies of the reader fixtures and real front-end-emitted corpus
  modules with a deterministic PRNG. A clean exit means no input, valid or
  hostile, drove undefined behavior through the pipeline. The harness
  (`kobold/kpm_fuzz.c`) also reads one module from stdin without `--mutate`, the
  entry an external fuzzer (AFL++) or byte loop drives for a longer campaign. It
  is wired into `check-san`.
- **In-tree, source**: `tests/kp-src/<name>.pas` paired with `<name>.expected`
  (stdout) are compiled and run end to end by `tests/run-kp-src-tests.sh` in
  three modes. `make check-kp-frontend` is a host smoke of the embedded front end
  (`--emit-kpm` yields a `.kpm 1` module). `make check-kp-jit` compiles and runs
  each fixture in one process; `make check-kp-aot` emits a module with the native
  `skj-kpc`, AOT-compiles and links it, and runs it. The three x86 targets are in
  `check-all`; the cross runs `check-kp-jit-rv`, `check-kp-jit-arm64`,
  `check-kp-aot-rv`, and `check-kp-aot-arm64` run under qemu in `check-emu-all`.
  `tests/kp-src` is the portable set: every mode, including the freestanding one,
  runs it, so it stays to integer, string, int64, and parameters.
- **In-tree, behavioral corpus**: `tests/kp-corpus` is the broader behavioral set,
  71 real Kobold programs. Each `<name>.expected` is the program's stdout as
  produced by the **independent** reference VM `kprun`, not by a skjegg tool, so
  the corpus is an oracle, not a self-comparison. It covers arithmetic, records,
  arrays, maps, dynamic arrays, strings, enums, sets, coroutines, reals and
  transcendentals, int64, casts, var parameters, and control flow. One
  `.expected` pins the result across the x86-64 JIT and the x86-64, rv32, and
  arm64 AOT paths at once, so it also checks that every backend agrees.
  `make check-kp-corpus` runs the x86 JIT and AOT (in `check-all`);
  `check-kp-corpus-rv` and `check-kp-corpus-arm64` run the AOT path under qemu (in
  `check-emu-all`); `check-kp-corpus-cf` runs the ColdFire AOT path under qemu-m68k
  (in `check-all`), the big-endian cross-check, linking the hosted ColdFire runtime
  `libkpaot-cf.a` statically. The corpus is 83 programs, the failable two-return
  (`CALL2`) cases `failforms`/`failmethod`/`failmanaged` among them (see the reader
  note below); `failmanaged` covers `or else` recovering a managed result, and
  `failmethodwide` covers a failable method returning a wide value (real, int64,
  record) through the hidden caller buffer, the same sret path a failable free
  function uses reached through a by-reference receiver. `setelem` covers a set as
  a dynamic-array element and a map value, both a small set (the i64 scalar slot)
  and a large set (the inline blit slot). The ten `conf_*` programs are a
  conformance set pinning documented corner cases across all four backends:
  `conf_divmod` (div/mod truncate toward zero, mod takes the dividend's sign),
  `conf_wrap` (two's-complement overflow wrap with no `Q+` switch), `conf_strcmp`
  (unsigned bytewise string order, shorter prefix first), `conf_setrel` (set
  subset/superset relations and union/difference/intersection), `conf_defaults`
  (a global reads as the zero of its type), and `conf_evalorder` (operands left
  to right, call arguments right to left). Six `conf_trap_*` programs pin the
  fault exit code (70, empty stdout, through a per-fixture `.exitcode` file):
  `conf_trap_divzero` (integer divide by zero, always checked), `conf_trap_mapkey`
  (a missing map key), `conf_trap_range` (an out-of-bounds index under `{$R+}`),
  `conf_trap_overflow` (a signed add past `maxint` under `{$Q+}`), and
  `conf_trap_divovf`/`conf_trap_modovf` (the most negative integer `div`/`mod`
  `-1`, whose unrepresentable quotient always traps `OVERFLOW`). The
  divide-by-zero and signed-overflow division cases are clean traps on every
  backend: the hardware behavior is unusable (RV32 divide returns the wrapped
  value with no fault, the m68k exception surfaces as a raw signal or SIGFPEs
  under qemu), so the backend synthesises a divisor guard and an INT_MIN/-1
  guard under the guarded trap policy on each.
- **In-tree, multi-unit corpus**: `tests/kp-multi` is the cross-module set, the
  one behavioral surface the single-module corpus cannot reach. A fixture is told
  apart by its first keyword: `program NAME;` is a test (paired with
  `NAME.expected`, again `kprun`'s stdout), `unit NAME;` is a dependency with no
  `.expected`. `tests/run-kp-multi-tests.sh` compiles every unit to its own module
  first, then runs the programs against the set: the JIT links the unit modules in
  memory, the AOT path links their objects (`aot-run.sh`), so one `.expected` also
  checks the two links agree. The five programs exercise cross-unit calls, a unit
  const, a unit's mutable global and `shared var`, an exported enum and record
  type, qualified `as`, and a transitive `uses` chain. `make check-kp-multi` runs
  the x86 JIT and AOT (in `check-all`); `check-kp-multi-rv` and
  `check-kp-multi-arm64` run the AOT path under qemu (in `check-emu-all`).
- **In-tree, input-dependent corpus**: `tests/kp-io` is the set that reads input,
  the one surface the other corpora omit (they run with no stdin and no
  arguments). A fixture may carry a `<name>.input` file (fed as the program's
  stdin) and a `<name>.args` file (one line, whitespace-separated, passed as its
  command line, so `ParamStr`/`ParamCount` see it); the `.expected` is the
  reference `kprun`'s output under the same stdin and arguments. `make check-kp-io`
  runs the x86 JIT and AOT (in `check-all`); `check-kp-io-rv`, `check-kp-io-arm64`,
  and `check-kp-io-free` run the AOT and freestanding paths under qemu (in
  `check-emu-all`), so the entry argument vector and the `read` seam are exercised
  on the no-libc tier too.
- **In-tree, include-file corpus**: `tests/kp-inc` covers the `{$I ...}` include
  directive. The directive splices the named file's text at the point it appears,
  resolved at compile time against the source directory, so a `<name>.inc` beside
  the program is found with no harness plumbing. One fixture splices expressions
  (a string and a number constant), one a whole procedure declaration; the
  `.expected` is the reference `kprun`'s output. `make check-kp-inc` runs the x86
  JIT and AOT (in `check-all`); `check-kp-inc-rv`, `check-kp-inc-arm64`, and
  `check-kp-inc-free` run the AOT and freestanding paths under qemu (in
  `check-emu-all`). The include is resolved by the host front end in every case,
  so the freestanding module carries the spliced text before codegen.
- **In-tree, bootstrap**: `make bootstrap-fpc` rebuilds the front end from source
  with `fpc` and asserts it emits the same RV32 seed as the `skj-pc`-built front
  end, the compiler-independence proof (see "The self-host and
  compiler-independence checks"). The in-guest `test-{rv,cf}-selfhost-kpc` targets
  assert the compiler reproduces its reference on the target.
- **Optional external cross-check**: a reference `kprun` build, when one is
  available, can run a wider byte-identical-stdout comparison (the full
  74-to-76-case set, including input-dependent programs) than the in-tree
  corpora. `kobold/aot-check.sh` runs skjegg's AOT path against it and
  `kobold/aot-run.sh` stands in for `kprun`, when `KPDIR` and `KPRUN` point at
  such a tree. Neither is wired into skjegg CI; the in-tree corpora are the
  committed oracle.

## Language documentation
